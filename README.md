# MASS

This site hosts all source files and executables required for utilizing MASS, a shape analysis tool for images described in Chuanromanee et al (2019).This tool has been developed to facilitate user-friendly morphological analysis of leaves, but may be extended to other samples as well. User instructions for installation and use are provided in the file MASSUserGuidelines.pdf

All MATLAB source files are available in the folder SourceFiles.

The installer MASSInstaller.exe (tested and verified on Windows machines) is available under releases. Please note that the executable will write data files to the local directory, thus the MASS.exe (on Windows) must be located in a folder where the user has write priveleges.

A sample image and resultant basic analysis files are available under the folder SampleFiles.
